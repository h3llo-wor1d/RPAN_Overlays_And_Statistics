This repository is a collection of various different streaming tools to enhance the streaming experience on the platform

Very... Carefully? idk how to explain this lmfao

Just watch my stream lol, I made this for myself anyway

## How to use?
Read the post this came from, I intend on adding more to this readme in the future!!!

## Q+A
- How did you figure out the rate limit for follower count requests?
> I guessed. Lucky guess, I guess? Usually it's like 10 per second, and I don't need it that fast, so I made it one every .5 seconds, making it 2 per second.

- Will there be a roadmap for future additions to this project?
> Absolutely!!! I plan on working on it on-stream TODAY (9/23/22), and asking for YOUR suggestions and ideas for new plugins/integrations for RPAN streamers.
