# RPAN Overlays and Statistics

## What is this repository???
This repository is a collection of various different streaming tools to enhance the streaming experience on the platform

## How does this work?
Basically, you spoof a login session with reddit, which allows you to get the "subscribers", or followers, analytic from your Reddit page, which would literally never be publicly accessible, for... whatever reason? I'm not really sure why the admins decided to do it, to be completely frank with you, and I honestly wish that they would just make it a public statistic.

## Cool but like how do I know it's real?
Just watch my streams lol, I made this for myself anyway

## How to use? (will be updated with future widget readmes as well)
Read `followerGoalWidget/readme.md` for more information on how to use the project!
All other future readmes will be in the project folders for each of the following widgets/things I release!

## Q+A
- How did you figure out the rate limit for follower count requests?
> I guessed. Lucky guess, I guess? Usually it's like 10 per second, and I don't need it that fast, so I made it one every .5 seconds, making it 2 per second. Note: I was able to run this for around 12+ hours from 9/23 to 9/24 with no rate limit issues at all.

- Will there be a roadmap for future additions to this project?
> Absolutely!!! I plan on adding so much more than just a stupid follower goal widget lol.
